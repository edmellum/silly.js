# Silly.js

A DOM library built for the heck of it. Other implementations were purposefully not studied while building it so it shouldn't be considered usable by any means.

I've tried to implement APIs I liked from using different DOM libraries, consequently all of it pretty much looks like jQuery. Sadly most of what I've previously read of jQuery's source has left my mind so all of the implementation is dirty, fun and doesn't support anything but the specific Chrome version I used while coding.

# TODO
- Some silly tests
- A silly selector engine
- Animations(silly)
